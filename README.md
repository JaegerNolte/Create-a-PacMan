Pacman Assignment

Description: The create a Pacman assigment is designed to create an new pacman, once everytime "Add PacMan" is clicked.
When the PacMen are on screen they should move across the screen randomly and bounce off edges. 

How to run: First install all associated files of the Repository on GitHub and place them into a individual folder.
Once done open a web browser and search "about:blank". The last step is to click and drag the "index.html" file onto the blank 
browser. Congrats! You can play Create a PacMan!

Future Improvements: I plan to make ghost that will collide with the pacmen, serving as pacmen v. ghost fight.
